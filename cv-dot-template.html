    <span id=001>[<a class=t href=#001>001</a>]</span> Overview
    ________________________________________________________________________________
    
    Kiss Linuxâ„¢ is a meta-distribution for the x86_64 architecture with a focus on
    simplicity, sustainability and user freedom. The project was created by
    Dylan Araps who also acts as its sole developer and BDFL [<a class=t href=#0>0</a>].
    
    The distribution is designed to be maintainable by a single person and to this
    end has no infrastructure, backend or monetary running costs. Further, all
    installations of KISS contain everything needed to continue its development.
    
    The user is provided with three things.
    
    1. The Official Repositories - An extensible base including a fully X11-less
       Wayland environment, modern web browser, media player and everything needed
       for this system to rebuild (and update) itself (in under 120 packages).
    
    2. The Package Management System - A pleasant to work with and concise
       package format powered by a small, portable and self-contained package
       manager (written in POSIX shell).
    
    3. The Freedom To Go It Alone - Users can choose to maintain their system
       themselves thus freeing them from all external influence. The system then
       belongs to the user and they become totally self-reliant.
    
    
    <span id=002>[<a class=t href=#002>002</a>]</span> Software Distribution Model
    ________________________________________________________________________________
    
    The distribution is "rolling release" [<a class=t href=#1>1</a>] (install once, update perpetually)
    with the compilation process taking place on the user's machine. Updates to the
    distribution merely contain instructions for how each package is built.
    
    This model gives the user control over the compilation process while also
    removing the need for the distribution to have the necessary infrastructure
    to churn out and distribute binaries on a daily basis.
    
    
    <span id=003>[<a class=t href=#003>003</a>]</span> The Official Repositories
    ________________________________________________________________________________
    
    The problem with monolithic repositories is that they have no clear end. They
    have infinite growth possibility, very broad scope and rely on volunteer effort
    to keep everything fresh. They become harder to maintain over time and unless
    their growth is checked, will eventually become unsustainable.
    
    Kiss Linux's repositories are instead designed to be small and understandable.
    Instead of attempting to package the world they act as an extensible base which
    users can build upon to suit their needs.
    
    To best illustrate, here is the entire thing (121 components) (24/09/2021).

    wayland wayland-protocols wbg wl-clipboard wlroots wlsunset xkeyboard-config
    
    The distribution explicitly excludes logind, udev, dbus, systemd, polkit,
    pulseaudio, electron and all desktop environments. This software is either
    with lock-in, too complex or otherwise out of scope.

    <span id=004>[<a class=t href=#004>004</a>]</span> Package System
    ________________________________________________________________________________
    
    The system is based around directories and files. A repository (directory)
    contains packages (directories) which contain information (files). Repositories
    can be stored anywhere and their use is determined by a search path.
    
    As software is compiled locally, there is no line drawn between the "frontend"
    and "backend", they are one and the same. Learning the package management
    system also teaches you how to develop the distribution.
    
    * repository/
        * package-a/
            * build
            * checksums
            * depends
            * sources
            * version
        * package-b/
            * build
            * checksums
            * patches/
                * 0001-fix-segfault.patch
                * 0002-no-x11.patch
            * sources
            * version
    
    Each file serves a specific purpose and files can be omitted when the package
    has no use for them. Files can be symbolically linked between packages to
    deduplicate otherwise identical information.

    <span id=005>[<a class=t href=#005>005</a>]</span> Package Manager
    ________________________________________________________________________________
    
    The package manager (also named 'kiss') is a tiny, self-contained and POSIX
    compliant shell script written with portability in mind. It should run in all
    environments with a POSIX shell and core utilities.
    
    There is no configuration file and no weird arguments to memorize. Interaction
    is done via "actions" with each action taking a list of packages to operate on.
    Each action also has a single letter alias (build == b).
    
    * kiss [a|b|c|d|i|l|r|s|u|U|v] [pkg]...
    * alternatives   List and swap alternatives
    * build          Build packages
    * checksum       Generate checksums
    * download       Download sources
    * install        Install packages
    * list           List installed packages
    * remove         Remove packages
    * search         Search for packages
    * update         Update the system and repositories
    * Upgrade        Upgrade the system
    * version        Package manager version
